# Linear Regression

This module demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression** using a simple house price dataset, where house price is predicted based on house size.

## 📊 Example Output

### House Price vs Size (Training & Test Set)

![Regression Plot](assets/Linear_Regression_House_Price.png)

This visualization shows the relationship between **house size** (independent variable) and **house price** (dependent variable).

- The **scatter points** represent actual data values.
- The **straight line** represents the linear regression best-fit line.
- Separate plots are shown for **training data** and **test data** to illustrate how the model generalizes.

## 📌 Description

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to model the linear relationship between an input feature and a target variable.  
In this project, the model learns how house prices change with respect to house size and visualizes the learned relationship using a regression line.

---

## 🔁 Workflow

1. Load the dataset containing house size and price
2. Split the dataset into training and test sets
3. Train a linear regression model on the training data
4. Plot the regression line along with training data points
5. Evaluate and visualize the model on test data

## 📐 Linear Regression Formula

The model follows the equation:

y = mx + c


Where:
- `x` = House size  
- `y` = House price  
- `m` = Slope of the regression line  
- `c` = Intercept

## 📈 Conclusion

The plotted regression line shows a strong linear relationship between house size and house price, demonstrating how linear regression can effectively model and visualize real-world data trends.
